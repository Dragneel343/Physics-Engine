# 2D Physics Engine
This is a the beginnings of a 2D physics engine for Python using OpenCV. The purpose of this project was to practice our skills using OpenCV and expand our knowledge of computer graphics. The physics are calculated in real time--it is not prerendered or simulated to allow implementation of user interaction and application to games and other applications.

Run the engine.py script to run program.

## Future Work
* Fix ball to ball collision resolution to calculate future collisions to avoid incorrect overlap
* Implement ball to polygon collision resolution
* Implement threading to allow user interaction
